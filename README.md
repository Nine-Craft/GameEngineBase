# GameEngineBase
Creates a Base template/starting point for starting out to attempt a game engine and everything set up properly
Using Visual Studios supporting C++17, premake as build configuration and using precompile-headers.
The Solution is split into two projects : Engine and SandBox where engine is the core technology and Sandbox is the application that uses the core technology(e.g. editor)
